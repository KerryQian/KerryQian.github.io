      This project was a collaboration with Greening Australia, a non-profit
      organisation who's main goal is to restore and protect Australia's
      biodiversity. Our main goal for this project was to produce a prototype
      tool in grasshoper that would allow for users to see how the growth of
      vegetation (grass, bushes, & trees) would affect their land in terms of
      visual, and thermal comfort. Within the project, I was in charge of the
      modelling of vegetation growth as well as the generation of topography for
      the vegetation to grow from.
      <br /><br />
      The modelling of the vegetation required that it would be possible to
      simulate the growth of vegetation on land within any set timeframe ranging
      from a sappling to a fully mature tree. In addition to this, I was also
      tasked with generating a topography of land given land lines and from
      there, simulate the seeding and growing of the vegetation.
